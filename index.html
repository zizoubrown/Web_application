                <h3>Hello there!</h3>
                <p>We all our date of birth, atlist most of us, but do you know what day of the week you were born?
                   Hardly! You might be there hating mondays but probably have no idea that it is the day you were born.
                   <em>Maybe then you will have a different perspective towards mondays.</em> I was born on wednesday and
                   came to know this after alot of research that you might not have to do anymore.
                </p>
                <p>This website is going to make it easier for you. By just a click, you will learn two things. One, the day 
                   of the week that you were born and two, your <strong>Akan name.</strong> Akan naming is a ghanian culture 
                   where children are given their names as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
                </p>
                <p>You don't have to be from ghana to try this out, it's kinda fun also to know what akan name you might have had
                   if you were a ghanian. Don't forget to invite your friends and family here <strong>Mr Kwadwo/ Mis Adwoa.ðŸ˜‰</strong>
                   [that is a ghanian name for a boy and a girl who are born on monday]
